# TGCNet (Transformer-Based Graph Coarsening Network)
Official implementation of the paper *"Bridging Training and Execution via Dynamic Directed Graph-Based Communication in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems"* (AAAI Oral 2025). This repository contains PyTorch code for training and evaluating TGCNet on cooperative multi-agent benchmarks including [StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac), [Level-Based Foraging (LBF)](https://github.com/uoe-agents/lb-foraging), and [Hallway](https://github.com/TonghanWang/NDQ). The implementation is built upon the [EPyMARL](https://github.com/uoe-agents/epymarl) framework.
